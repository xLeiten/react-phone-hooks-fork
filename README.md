This comprehensive toolkit features custom hooks and utility functions tailored for phone number formatting, parsing,
and validation. It supports international standards, making it suitable for phone number processing applications across
different countries and regions.

## Usage

This library can be used to build a phone number input component with a country selector for React applications. As well
as to parse the phone metadata, validate phone numbers, format raw phone numbers into a more readable format and the
opposite. You can use the [development](./development) to test and develop your own components.

```jsx
import {getFormattedNumber, getMetadata, parsePhoneNumber, useMask} from "react-phone-hooks";

getFormattedNumber("440201111111"); // +44 (02) 011 11111
getMetadata("440201111111"); // ["gb", "United Kingdom", "44", "+44 (..) ... ....."]
parsePhoneNumber("+44 (02) 011 11111"); // {countryCode: 44, areaCode: "02", phoneNumber: "01111111", isoCode: "gb"}

const PhoneInput = (props) => {
    return <input {...useMask("+1 (...) ... ....")} {...props}/>
}
```
